(1) Folder "Images" contains 5500 frontal, unoccluded faces aged from 15 to 60 with neutral expression. It can be divided into four subsets with different races and gender, including 2000 Asian females, 2000 Asian males, 750 Caucasian females and 750 Caucasian males.

(2) This project compares 2 architectures for facial beauty evaludation based on SCUT-FBP5500 dataset: traditional Convolutional Neural Networks along with a novel approach: transfer learning with Vision Transformer fine-tuned on this task. The results can be found in ISODS-Facial Beauty Evaluation pdf file. This repo also adopts another pdf file written by the author for Object Detection in Videos
